Three Prolog projects, based on the book "Adventure in Prolog" by Dennis Merritt.

1. A text-based adventure game called "Nani search".
2. A family tree.
	I chose to use the family trees of the characters in Jane Austen's novel "Pride and Prejudice". Find their genealogy here: http://larasormiston.blogspot.com/2014/07/a-pride-and-prejudice-relationship-chart.html
3. A data base of customer orders.
